# MDB Web Server

This repository contains a small Flask application that allows uploading a
Microsoft Access `.mdb` file. After uploading, the server exports the
`Instruments` table to an Excel workbook and reports how many valid instruments
were found using the Microsoft Access ODBC driver via `pyodbc` and
`openpyxl`.

## Requirements

* Python 3.11+
* `Flask` Python package
* `pyodbc` package
* Microsoft Access ODBC driver (installed with Microsoft Office/Access)
* `openpyxl` package

You can install the Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install flask pyodbc openpyxl
```

This application requires the Microsoft Access ODBC driver. On Windows this
driver is installed when Microsoft Access or the Access Database Engine is
present. Ensure the driver name `Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)` is
available on your system.

## Running

Start the server with:

```bash
python server.py
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
You'll see a simple home page where you can choose to export instruments to
Excel or update an MDB from an exported Excel workbook. Selecting **Export
Instruments** presents a form to upload an `.mdb` file. After uploading, the
server exports the `Instruments` table to an Excel workbook and provides a link
to download it, reporting how many instruments were found.


## Updating an MDB from Excel

From the home page choose **Update From Excel** or visit `/import` directly.
Upload an existing MDB file together with an Excel workbook generated by this
program. The server verifies that each sheet has the same column layout,
ensures each row's `ID` and `Tag` already exist in the database, and only
updates fields that have changed. After the update you can download the
modified MDB file.
